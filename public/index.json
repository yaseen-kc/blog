[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe you can truly move on from someone you love. Even after months or years, just hearing their name, a familiar song, or having a memory of something they said can bring everything back. I still find myself spending nights feeling sad about someone who stayed in my thoughts much longer than they were in my life. The worst part is, I can\u0026rsquo;t control who I feel this way about.\nIt feels terrible to think about all the great people I\u0026rsquo;ve missed while focusing on this one person. I feel like I let myself down, loving someone who didn’t think about my feelings the same way I did about theirs. I told myself I was a victim of loving too much, caring too deeply. But that isn’t true. In reality, they probably did care about me, but things just didn\u0026rsquo;t work out. That hurts even more. They cared, but fading feelings and life circumstances don’t always match how much someone wishes you happiness.\nBlaming them made it easier for me. It was simpler to think they were wrong. But deep down, I know it wasn’t going to work. And here I am, feeling lonely. They don’t want to be with me, and they likely want me to move on. My friends and family feel the same they know this person wasn’t right for me, and they hope I can let go. Even a part of me wants to move on, to accept that if it was meant to be, it would have happened. But another part of me still holds on, feeling that life can’t continue without them.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like sitting in a movie theater after the film has ended. Everyone has left, the lights are on, but I’m still there, pretending the movie isn’t over.\nOddly, I find comfort knowing I\u0026rsquo;m not the only one who feels this way. I\u0026rsquo;m sure many people I pass by on the bus, at work, even my friends and family carry this same feeling of lost love. It’s like an unspoken connection between us, a shared sadness. It finally makes sense why so many adults seem a little sad or careful when talking about love.\nWhen I was younger, I thought I’d get through love without getting hurt. But now I know better. We all get hurt. We all fall. First loves so strong, pure, and blind—knock us down. But we get back up. I do. We all do. We continue with our lives, go to work, maybe go on dates again. We live. And we learn that even though we may not fully get over someone we loved, it doesn’t mean life stops.\nThese memories shape who we are. They remind us how much we were willing to risk. And despite everything, I’m still here, still willing to give life, and maybe love, another chance. It feels heavier now, more real, and moments of happiness are fewer. But when I do feel happy, it feels more meaningful.\nSometimes, I still think I could have done things differently, or that I was wronged. But in the end, no one is responsible for my feelings but me. I did my best, and so did they, in their own way. And while my heart may still say life without them is pointless, I’ve learned that my heart isn’t fully in control.\nI’m not in charge of fate, love, or chance. I’m just trying to find my way forward, hoping the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t another problem. Realizing this has helped me relax a little. Who knows what’s going to happen? Who I’ll meet? Where I’m going? All I know is that even though they’re still in my thoughts, life is worth living.\nAnd maybe that’s the most amazing thing so many of us go through this, still moving forward even after losing someone special. Maybe we never fully get over those we love, but we learn to live without them. In the end, we choose the one love that’s always within our control: the love we have for ourselves.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/getting-over-someone-you-love/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe you can truly move on from someone you love.
